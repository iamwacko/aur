# My AUR Package Maintenance

## What packages aren't here
Some packages have issues that mean they don't really fit in here, but I'm still the AUR maintainer.

- ruget-bin: The author hasn't released new binaries in a while, despite having new releases
- finalcrypt: They don't seem to use any kind of VCS or anything, so I don't want to bother figuring out how make a .nvchecker.toml for it.

## Upstream changes?
Some upstreams have errors, or are unmaintained. I might want to help.

- cargo-benchcmp: warnings during build
- cargo-docs: failed to build
- cwtch-server: files can't be removed
- cwtch-server-git: same as non -git
- doitlive: fails to build
- ede: fails to build
- libcwtch-go: files can't be removed
- libcwtch-go-git: files can't be removed
